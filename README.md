## tjungblut-math

This is my own Math library. It features some daily math operations on sparse/dense vectors and matrices.

Features
--------

- Basic linear algebra primitives and operations
- Sparse (Ordered, Unordered, Bit, Named, OneDimensional and Keyed) and Dense vector
- Sparse and Dense matrix (row-wise sharding, column major ordering)
- Tuples (two and three dimensional)
- Functions on all primitives for lambdas in Java 8

Roadmap
-------

- Byte code optimizer (read further below)
- Tensors
- More operations and implementations of the interfaces

Trivia
------

Parts of this library are also featured in Apache Hama's ML module and power several algorithms there.

Chain Calling
-------------

My library was intentionally build to easily translate octave/matlab code from MOOC's to Java.
For example the following octave code (simple gradient descent):

> theta = theta - alpha * gradient;

Is written in Java as: 

```java
double alpha = 0.1;
DoubleVector theta = new DenseDoubleVector(new double[] {x, y});
DoubleVector gradient = new DenseDoubleVector(new double[] {1, 1});
theta = theta.subtract(gradient.multiply(alpha));
```
You see that this is a bit more expressive and verbose, but since you can't overload operators this is the only way to solve it.

### Also note:

Since this method chaining requires multiple iterations on the internal datastructure, this might be slower than hand-optimized code.
Take the simple euclidian distance for example:

> Math.sqrt(vec2.subtract(vec1).pow(2).sum());

This will need to iterate three times over your whole vector size of size N (subtract, pow and sum). So you have a quite high constant opposed to a single loop from 0 to N:

```java
double sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < vec1.getLength(); i++) {
  double diff = vec2[i] - vec1[i];
  sum += (diff * diff);
}
```

Currently I have an idea to write a bytecode optimizer that will unchain such calls to minimize the performance penalty.
This optimizer would be hooked into a classloader and optimize the bytecode at load-time or at build time as part of maven.

Benchmarks
-------

You may want to see a Caliper benchmark result of comparing matrix multiplications of square matrices using GPU (JCUDA)/ JBLAS (lapack lite)/ Java implementations on windows:

```

```

Until ~50x50 there is no benefit in using JBLAS and even later on there is little benefit. This is largely due to the overhead of copying the matrix representations 
from heap to native memory and the slowness of lapack lite. 
The GPU gives great improvements when matrices get very large > 500x500 and copy costs (main to device memory) start to amortize itself.
 
On Linux this looks a bit more in favor of JBLAS (take care, this is comparing different hardware):

ATLAS does in fact better from 10x10 matrices. The GPU outperforms the Java code earlier on 100x100 matrices, and outperforms ATLAS from 500x500. The difference isn't extreme between ATLAS and the GPU, because I benchmarked on a laptop and the memory interface width is much more narrow than on the desktop (128 bit vs. at least 384 bit).

The benchmark code can be found [here.](https://gist.github.com/thomasjungblut/5652037 "here")
